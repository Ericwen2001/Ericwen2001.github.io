<h2>about me</h2>
I am an MRes graduate from the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, supervised by <a href="https://christopherlu.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Chris Xiaoxuan Lu</a> . 

My research focuses on advancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of multimodal sensor learning. These efforts aim to support applications (e.g. localization, mapping) in mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, and AIoT systems. Currently, my work emphasizes leveraging **thermal cameras** and **4D imaging radar** to overcome challenges posed by adverse weather and illumination conditions.

I received my B.Eng degree with the first class honour School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh (2019-2023).

ðŸ‘‰ I am open to collaborations and potential PhD/research internships in 2024. Please feel free to reach out via email wenxiangyu2001[at]gmail.com if you think we could work together!
